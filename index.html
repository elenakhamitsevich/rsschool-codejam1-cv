            Today in all our daily life there is a part of programming.
            Being part of this maelstrom I want to understand how it all works. 
            Desire, interest, thirst for new knowledge - the engines of the process. 
            The programmer must have a flexible mind and good imagination. 
            Work in this profession requires perseverance, accuracy and attention. 
            However, the result is worth it, because you can realize any of your imagination in your code. 
            And give this code to the world.</p>
